# Deployment Plan

## Quick Deploy with Azure App Service
For this demo, I will use Azure App Service to deploy our application. I choose this because I have used it recently and it is easy to get started.

It is also free, and you can deploy your application in minutes.

todo manual deploy

## Setup CI/CD


## Future Deployment Options

I would move to Docker as an iterration for production, and most likely try Azure Container Instances.
I'm interested to learn more about this, and may migrate some of my other projects to this.
I have expience in docker but not Kubernetes. I'd rather the deployments being more consistent with the development environments, which I believe this would allow.
